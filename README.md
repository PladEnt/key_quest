# KeyQuest

Welcome to Key Quest. Key quest is a dungeon crawler where you try to find the key and make it to the door, all while trying not to be killed by the monsters. The levels are randomly generated, and get harder as you go, so it will be different every time. collect bombs to destroy walls to clear your path and see how far you can make it. P.S. My best is level 43, try and best that ;)
